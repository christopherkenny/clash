`clash` provides an R interface to the [Clash of Clans
API](https://developer.clashofclans.com/#/).

## Installation

You can install the development version of `clash` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("christopherkenny/clash")
```

## Example

Current endpoints are included for cards, rankings, tournaments, players, and clans.

To get a player’s data, we can use:

```{r example}
library(clash)

coc_get_player('92GCQQYP')
```

To get a clan, we can use:

```{r}
clan <- coc_get_clan('8UC2J9OY')
clan
```
This returns clan-level attributes, such as lists of members in the clan:

```{r}
clan$member_list
```
